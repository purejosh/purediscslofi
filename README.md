# Pure Discs - Lofi Edition

Pure Discs - Lofi Edition adds multiple lofi editions of existing Minecraft discs!

This mod is intended to be used alongside my other mods, which I'm calling "micro-mods". I aim to combat bloated, overproduced mods with my simplistic, segmented micro-mods. Curate your own features without editing confusing config files and disabling recipes. Check my profile to find more mods, and complete your pack!
